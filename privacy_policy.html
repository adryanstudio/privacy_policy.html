    <h1>Privacy Policy for the Pulse App</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and protected within the Pulse mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The Pulse app does not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email address, precise location, etc.) from your device.</p>
    <p>The only information stored by the app is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quotes that you mark as favorites (these are saved only locally, on your device, within the app's internal database and are not transmitted anywhere).</li>
        <li>App settings (such as text size), which are also saved only locally on your device to customize the user experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app uses internet connectivity only when you initiate an explicit action, such as sharing a quote or saving it as an image (a process that may involve standard Android system services and libraries).</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the app stores data only locally on your device, the security of this data depends on the security measures of your device's Android operating system and the protection measures you take for your device (e.g., password, fingerprint).</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app may use certain standard libraries or services provided by the Android operating system or Google Play Services (which may collect anonymous usage data or telemetry, according to their own policies). These may include, but are not limited to, services necessary for functionalities like sharing or managing media files (when saving as an image). Please consult the privacy policies of these third-party services for more details.</p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>


    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
